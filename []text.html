    All of the works in this showcase began with a critical view of Western traditional dualism(dichotomy) through post-humanism theory. My interest and thoughts in dualistic, dichotomous forms and phenomena have led to numerous questions, and the key questions underlying the works so far are as follows.
    Can dichotomy be transcended? If possible, what is the way? Also, how can it be sublimated into a work of art?
    What is the middle(or neutral) in continuous polarisation and what is the range?
    How many things, visible or invisible, are already formed under dualism?
    Penetrating these questions inevitably makes us realise that when something is divided dichotomously, there is a middle ground somewhere in between. Critical thinking about dualism leads to exploring and experimenting with the endless potential possibilities of intermediate (or neutrality), and many of the works in this showcase compare and realise intermediate possibilities in each form, visible or invisible.
    In addition, critical thinking about Western traditional dualism and the exploration of "middle" naturally leads to thinking about Korean society as a whole. Korea is also experiencing social problems and conflicts due to continuous polarisation, especially its art education system, which is based due to college entrance, professionalism, and artistry. Concerns and interest in the Korean art education system play an important role in expanding interest in dualism to social interest. Critical thinking about the Korean art education system has resulted in a variety of questions, and the questions underlying one of my works, "Doing art (Film)" are as follows.
    What is art in the Korean art education system? Or what should be art?
    Why can't the skills, practices, labor, and processes that always exist with results be art themselves?
    What are the criteria for judging works of art?
    The result is art?
    What is more artistic and what is less artistic?
    "Doing art (Performance)" which is one of my works based on above questions is a critical reflection of the Korean art education system that distinguishing art from what is not. However, this critical reflection is not limited to the Korean art education system, but also leads to concerns about Korean society as a whole, resulting in numerous questions to think about the problems and conflicts that arise in Korean society. Also, my concern and interest in Korean society is likely to expand not just to think about Korean society, but to various social problems and concerns that are occurring in many other countries.
